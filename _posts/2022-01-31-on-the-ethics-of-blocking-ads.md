There's a discussion on Hacker News right now about ad blocking. Most of the commenters are unsurprisingly pro-adblock, but there was one divergent comment that stood out to me.

I'm not going to get into the adblock debate here; it's been discussed to death at this point and I don't think anyone on either side of the debate is changing their minds. I'm instead going to explore how this debate highlights two very different perspectives on what the web is or should be.

The primary point of conflict is the role of the web browser. 

# Implicit agreements

Here's [the comment that struck me](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30150367):

> Because the implicit agreement of a site with adverts is that the content's available to you with the adverts on it. If you don't like that you don't have to read it, but if you remove them automatically then I think it's hard to argue you aren't breaking an implied agreement.
