After last week's conferences, I thought it would be a good idea to plan out exactly what I'm going to do differently based on what I've learned. I don't want to overwhelm myself with too many things, so I'm limiting myself to a few key items for improvement. I will come back later to evaluate progress in these areas.

* Start reading *Music by the Numbers* by Eli Maor. This book has been sitting in our living room for a while now, and I haven't yet really started it.
* Dedicate one hour every Friday to weekly planning for my work. Include in this time an analysis of stakeholders and updating the project roadmap.
* Help team members to discover solutions for themselves and grow as developers. Do not give solutions, help them to find solutions themselves. Do as little low-level micromanagement as possible.

In a week, I'll evaluate how I did and see what's next.
